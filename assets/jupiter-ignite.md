  ## Description:
  This project uses npm with inquirer and jest to ask questions to create an html document that displays a new development team. I was challenged in this by using some new concepts such as javascript classes, unit testing and using node's inquirer to reach new heights. within this repo you will find links to sample videos of how the application works and how its unit tests are performed. over all this project was a fun challenge that used concepts from the previous project and expanded on them to still keep it fresh and entertaining while coding it.
