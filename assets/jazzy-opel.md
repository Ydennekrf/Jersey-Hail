  ## Description:
  This project uses the power of express.js to create the routes between a previously established front end and newly created backend. By doing this project it shows the capabilities of express routing and the basics of how to set up a primitive database. I used this as a fun but challenging puzzle on where and how to connect end points and the logic to be used when the end point was reached.
